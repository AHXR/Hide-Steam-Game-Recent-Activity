# Hide Steam Game Recent Activity (Windows)

Simple and easy. Run the program and it will hide your Steam games. Make sure CS:GO isn't your most recent played game. If it is, simply run another game and exit. This uses the
CS:GO Player Profiles app to hide your games. As a result, the Steam process will be terminated once all player profiles are ran. This is so Steam doesn't process you closing out
the Player Profiles app, which will leave it on your Recent Activity.
